## Idea/Description

Idea behind this project is to create a website for existing Ice Cream Van business I work for over the weekends. I want to make it light, easy to browse on the varaity of different devices with most useful info about company and what they do. Sort of "business card" website. 

>**Important:** I have agreed with business owner to use any text or images (not code) off his current website for this project for learning purposes, their usage will be credited here or in the comments by their code.

## Roadmap (will be marked off once done)

I intend to create a 4-page website that includes:

1. **Home page**

    General information, why us, good hygene, friendly staff, maybe use some picture slides, book now button in the middle.

2. **Events (book now)**

    Contact form made for event booking/reservations/date request, information about general practice, pop up window after "submit" saying "we will be in touch soon‚Äù.

3. **About**

    General about page with short description, map and company address, contact details.

4th page ideas:

  * **Trays:** 

    Seasonal stuff, menu and information how and where to follow us to find out when we'll be in the area.

  * **Charity:** 

    in what charity events we participated lately or what charities we support, pictures, stories, etc.
